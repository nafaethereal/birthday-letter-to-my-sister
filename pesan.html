    <h2>Happy Birthday, Mba Nia</h2>

<p>
  Before anything else, let me say this first.
  I’m writing this in English not because I want to sound fancy,
  but simply because it feels easier for me to be honest this way.
  Somehow, my feelings come out more gently in this language.
</p>

<p>
  Also… please accept this as my birthday gift for now.
  I know it’s not something you can hold in your hands.
  I’m still a bit broke and haven’t been able to buy you a proper present yet
  (you know how it is).
  So please wait for the real one, hopefully coming soon,
  when life is a little kinder to me financially.
</p>

<p>
  Happy birthday, Mba Nia.
  From the deepest part of my heart,
  I wish you a life filled with peace and happiness.
  May your path always be guided and protected,
  may your sustenance be abundant and never lacking,
  and may your heart always find its way back to calm,
  even on days when life feels heavy.
</p>

<p>
  I hope you continue to be the best mother for Zayyan and Zayden —
  a mother who loves deeply, sacrifices quietly, and always strong.
  May your home always be filled with warmth, understanding, and laughter.
  And may everything you have been wishing for,
  even the ones you keep to yourself,
  slowly find their way to you at the right time.
</p>

<h3>Things I Hope You Never Forget</h3>

<p>
  Please don’t listen to negative voices around you.
  Don’t let anyone make you feel small,
  and don’t ever believe that you are a failure.
  Because from where I stand,
  you are not one — not even close.
</p>

<p>
  To me, you are an incredibly strong and admirable sister.
  You have been through so much,
  carried so many responsibilities,
  and survived things that not everyone could.
  The fact that you are still standing,
  still caring, still loving,
  already says more than any words ever could.
</p>

<p>
  No matter what people say,
  no matter how loud the doubts become,
  please know that I believe in you.
  I always have.
</p>

<h3>Thank You for Everything</h3>

<p>
  Thank you for being my sister all this time.
  Thank you for staying strong for so many years,
  for always trying your best to give me what I needed,
  even when it wasn’t easy for you.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you for teaching me about life —
  about patience, responsibility, and resilience —
  sometimes without even realizing you were doing it.
  A lot of who I am today comes from watching you.
</p>

<p>
  I’m sorry if I’ve been lacking in many ways.
  I’m sorry if I’ve been stubborn,
  if I didn’t always listen when I should have,
  or if I disappointed you more times than I realized.
</p>

<h3>Things I Rarely Say</h3>

<p>
  I sincerely hope your life is always surrounded by happiness.
  I hope you stay strong in facing whatever problems come your way,
  and that your heart remains protected
  whenever you hear harsh or negative words from others.
</p>

<p>
  I’m sorry if my presence ever felt like a burden to you.
  I’m sorry if I haven’t met your expectations yet.
  And I’m truly sorry if, in any way,
  I’ve held you back from dreams
  that had to be postponed or sacrificed.
</p>

<h3>A Small Request</h3>

<p>
  Please keep praying for me.
  Pray that one day I can make Mama proud,
  make you proud,
  and make Bapa, Mas Adit,
  Zayyan, and Zayden happy too.
</p>

<p>
  I want to become someone who can give back,
  someone you can rely on,
  someone who can stand beside you with confidence.
</p>

<h3>Written from the Heart</h3>

<p>
  I hope you are always surrounded by kind and sincere people.
  I hope life ahead feels lighter,
  and that things slowly become easier for you.
</p>

<p>
  Whatever has been hurting you —
  physically, emotionally, or silently —
  I hope it heals little by little.
  Even if it takes time,
  I hope peace eventually finds its way back to you.
</p>

<p>
  Whatever you’re going through,
  please remember that you can always talk to me.
  Even if I’m not good at giving advice,
  even if I don’t always know the right words,
  I promise I will listen.
</p>

<p>
  I know sometimes I may look indifferent,
  distant, or too quiet in front of you.
  But please believe me when I say this:
  I care deeply — just in my own quiet way.
</p>

<p>
  Once again, happy birthday, Mba Nia.
  May you always find reasons to smile,
  may your heart feel lighter with each passing year,
  and may life always treat you gently.
</p>
